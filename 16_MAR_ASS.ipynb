        "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well. This can result in the model being too specialized to the training data and unable to generalize to new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting are poor performance on the test data, high variance, and a risk of the model being biased towards the training data. Overfitting can be mitigated by using techniques such as regularization, early stopping, and reducing the complexity of the model.\n",

This can result in the model being unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data, and may also result in poor performance on the test data. The consequences of underfitting are high bias, and a model that is unable to capture the complexity of the data. Underfitting can be mitigated by using more complex models, increasing the number of features, and increasing the amount of data.\n",

This can be achieved by using techniques such as cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model on different subsets of the data, and selecting the model with the best performance. It is also important to select appropriate hyperparameters for the model, such as the learning rate or regularization parameter, as these can affect the balance between overfitting and underfitting. Finally, it is important to monitor the performance of the model on both the training and test data, and adjust the model as necessary to improve performance."

The penalty term introduces a trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model's parameters small, thus reducing the complexity of the model. This helps prevent overfitting and can improve the model's generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",

        "1. L1 regularization: L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights. This penalty encourages the model to reduce the number of non-zero weights and can result in sparse models. Sparse models are useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets as they can help identify the most important features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. L2 regularization: L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This penalty encourages the model to distribute the weight values more evenly across all the features, thus reducing the impact of any one feature on the model's predictions.\n",

Dropout randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in a neural network during training, forcing the remaining neurons to learn more robust and independent features. Early stopping stops the training of a model before it reaches full convergence, preventing overfitting on the training data.\n",
