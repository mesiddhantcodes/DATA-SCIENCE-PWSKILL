        "\n",
        "ANS.  In feature selection, the filter method is a technique that evaluates the correlation between each feature and the target variable. It uses statistical measures such as correlation, mutual information, or chi-squared to rank the features based on their relevance to the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The filter method works by computing a metric for each feature that reflects its importance or relevance to the target variable. For example, in the case of correlation, the filter method calculates the correlation coefficient between each feature and the target variable. The higher the correlation coefficient, the more relevant the feature is considered to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "After computing the relevance score for each feature, the filter method ranks the features based on their scores and selects the top N features that are deemed to be most relevant. The number N can be set by the user or can be determined using cross-validation techniques."

        "Ans.  The wrapper method and the filter method are two different approaches to feature selection in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The wrapper method evaluates subsets of features by training a predictive model on each subset and evaluating its performance. It selects the subset of features that gives the best performance on the evaluation metric. In contrast, the filter method evaluates each feature independently of the others based on a statistical measure, such as correlation or mutual information, and selects the top-ranked features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The wrapper method is more computationally expensive than the filter method, as it involves training a model on each subset of features. However, it can better capture the interactions between features and select the most informative features for a particular model. It is often used when the goal is to optimize the performance of a specific model."

These methods aim to identify the most informative features for the model during the training phase, rather than separately selecting features before or after model training.\n",

        "Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Lasso Regression: Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, forcing the model to select only the most relevant features. The regularization parameter in Lasso Regression controls the degree of sparsity in the feature selection process.\n",

        "2.  Ridge Regression: Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function that shrinks the coefficients of less important features. This technique can reduce the impact of noisy or irrelevant features in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Elastic Net: Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression that balances the sparsity of Lasso with the stability of Ridge Regression."

        "\n",
        "1. Limited Scope: The Filter method evaluates each feature independently of the others based on a statistical measure, such as correlation or mutual information, and selects the top-ranked features. However, it does not consider the interaction between features, which can lead to suboptimal feature selection.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Insensitivity to Model Performance: The Filter method selects features based solely on their individual statistical properties and does not consider the model's performance. Therefore, it may not select the most informative features for a specific model, which could lead to suboptimal performance."
