        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. It involves transforming data into a standardized format that is suitable for storage, transmission, or processing. Data encoding is used in various fields, including data science, to improve data quality, compatibility, and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In the context of data science, data encoding serves several purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data Compression: Encoding techniques like run-length encoding, Huffman coding, or Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression can reduce the size of data by eliminating redundancy and encoding repeated patterns. This is useful for optimizing storage space and improving data transfer speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Feature Engineering: In machine learning, data encoding is often used to transform categorical variables into a numerical representation. This enables algorithms to process and analyze such data, as many machine learning algorithms work with numerical inputs. Common encoding techniques for categorical variables include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding."

        "**Ans:**Nominal encoding, also known as \"label encoding\" or \"integer encoding,\" is a data encoding technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations. In this method, each unique category is assigned a unique integer value. However, it is essential to note that there is no ordinal relationship or meaningful numerical order between the encoded values. It is merely a numeric label assigned to each category.\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is preferred over one-hot encoding in certain situations where the categorical variable has a large number of unique categories or when there is no meaningful ordinal relationship among the categories. Here are a few scenarios where nominal encoding is preferred:\n",

        "High cardinality categorical variables: When dealing with categorical variables that have a large number of unique categories, one-hot encoding can significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset. This can lead to the \"curse of dimensionality\" and result in computational inefficiency and increased memory requirements. In such cases, nominal encoding provides a more compact representation by assigning a unique integer label to each category.\n",

        "Example: Consider a dataset containing customer information, including a \"Country\" attribute.

Nominal encoding would be a more practical choice, assigning each country a unique integer label."
