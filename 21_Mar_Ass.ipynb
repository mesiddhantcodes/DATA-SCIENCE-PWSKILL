        "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two random variables. It describes how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. It is an essential concept in statistical analysis because it helps us understand the direction and strength of the relationship between variables.\n",

A positive covariance indicates a direct relationship, where both variables tend to increase or decrease together. A negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship, where one variable tends to increase as the other decreases. A covariance of zero suggests no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
