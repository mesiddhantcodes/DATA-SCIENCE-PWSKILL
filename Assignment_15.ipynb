        "  **SQL** (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two main types of databases that differ in their data models, schema, query language, and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with fixed columns and rows. The schema is predefined and requires a strict structure that allows for the data to be organized in a structured way, ensuring consistency, data integrity, and data relationships. SQL databases are widely used in enterprise applications where data is structured and relationships are well defined. The most popular SQL databases are **MySQL**, **Oracle**, and **SQL Server.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  **NoSQL** databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible and dynamic way. The data is stored in a document, graph, or key-value format, and the schema is flexible, allowing for changes in the data structure without the need to modify the schema. NoSQL databases are well suited for handling large amounts of unstructured data and for applications that require high scalability and performance. Some examples of NoSQL databases are **MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis .**\n",
